Introduction to Bioinformatics: Entry level course for any life sciences student. Students learn basic Python and Linux, and are introduced to common databases. Students are also exposed to many different fieds within the Life Sciences in which a bioinformatics skill set is helpful.2. Computational Biology: Covers major algorithms in bioinformatics. Students are expected to take five computer science classes before this course and are typically strong progrmmers. They code 20-30 different algorithms and learn the strengths/weaknesses of each, and finally they are asked to solve biological questions using their algorithms.3. Bioinformatics: Capstone course for bioinformatics majors. Students are given dataat the start of the semester and asked to test some hypothesis using computational tools they develop, or download. The questions they are expected to address typically have not been solved, so these tend to be real projects and from time-to-time lead to ublications.","Having people with extensive experience in dual disciplines.

I suppose that means I do teach a lot of bioinformatics content.",2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2_No,NA,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PDB, stat packages: R/Matlab/SAS",2_No,NA,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1_Female,5_White,2_Not Hispanic or Latino,4_Ph.D. (or equivalent),NA,7_2010,8_Post-graduate certificate,"4_Doctoral University (High, Higher, Highest Research Activity)",3_Don't know,"3_'> 15,000' students","3_'> 15,000' students",Department of Bioengineering,2_'10 - 20',3_'101 - 500',NA,"That students that tend to go down the biology path are afraid of math/lack confidence in math and struggle with problem solving and critical thinking.

In its simplest form, bioinformatics represents the use of computes to analyze and interpret various types of biological data. Bioinformatic skills are now indispensable for biologists and this course will introduce undergraduate students to the types of analyses biologists regularly perform at their computers. We will over topics such as accessing genomics databases, aligning DNA and protein sequences, searching genomic databases for similar sequences, analyzing protein structure, and building molecular phylogenies.At the end of this course you will have confidence i your ability to join a research laboratory and use your newly acquired skills to begin exploring the mountains of publicly available biological data.

Each week we will meet for Lectures will discuss available computational tools for extracting biological information from nucleotide and protein sequences.  The computer-based laboratry will employ bioinformatics software to demonstrate how to manage, search and analyze genetic sequences.  Laboratory sessions will include the use of programs to predict genes, perform multiple sequence alignments and analyses, predict protein secondarystructures, construct phylogenetic trees and access publically available databases.  Genomics (BIOL 340) School of Life Scienceshis course introduces students to the analysis of complex genomes. Emphasis is placed on genetic information derived from te human genome project but advances with genomes of other model systems will be discussed. Lectures cover scientific techniques used to map and sequence the human genome, as well as strategies for identification of disease susceptibility genes.

This course provides an integrated survey of fundamental questions in molecular biology and the computtional tools that are used to solve them. Elements of molecular biology and computer programming are presented in parallel throughout the semester. Topics include molecular sequence analysis (identifying repeats, regulatory/binding motifs, and genetic varation) using pattern-matching operations on text strings. Assignments will include writing Python programs to analyze human DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. Prerequisite: Biology 101 or consent of the instructor. BIOL331: Computational Systems Biology Full course for one semester (lecture-laboratory).  A survey of network models used to gain a systems-level understanding of biological processes.  Topics include computational models of gene regulation, signal transduction pathways, protein-protein inteactions, and metabolic pathways. Laboratory exercises will involve building a collection of biological networks from public data, implementing a graph library and foundational algorithms, and interpreting computational results. A programming-based indepenent project will answer biological questions by applying graph algorithms to experimental data.  BIOL431: Seminar Biology: Computational Cancer Biology.  Half course for one semester.  Investigation of computational methods to analyze high-throughput iological measurements collected from hundreds to thousands of cancer samples.

It relies on the newest tecniques and knowledge in genetics, computer science, and statistics. Unfortunately my experience with dedicated bioinformatics curriculum has been that the bioinformatics courses are taught as a hodgepodge, containing many different disciplines that studens are never able to fully master. Many of the students I have worked with walk away feeling as though they are more aware of bioinformatics, but have not mastered any part of it. I feel that many students would be better served by completing a degree in cmputer science with a masters in biology, or vice versa. However, with a rigorous curriculum combining genetics, computer science, and statistics, I do believe it would be possible to create a core bioinformatics program.",Charlotte,North Carolina,United States,SO,5

Spring semester. For students who participated in the SEA-PHAGES course in the fall semester. Meets twice per week for two hours. Students use BLAST, DNAMaster (ORF-finders), tRNA fnders, Dotplots, phylogenetic and distance analysis, and Phamerator to annotate, analyze, and compare phage genomes. Biology 354 - Investigations in Functional Genetics. Taught for the first time Spring 2016, and may be offered occasionally. Students dentify promoters and terminators from phage genomes using software found online. They design primers to amplify them and clone them into vectors containing fluorescent protein genes that facilitate the testing their promoting or terminating activity.omputer Science 300 - Bioinformatics. Can be taken for Biology 300-level credit. Co-taught by computer science faculty member and biology faculty member. Science students must have taken at least one programming course. Using the python language, studentslearn about and design algorithms. ROSALIND is used for assignments with great success.

Additionally, assessing stuent understanding of bioinformatics can be challenging depending on what is taught, and how.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,NA,NA,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,"I think that one of your questions highlighted an important issue in higher education - that you asked me to exclude adjuncts when counting faculty.  As institutions of higher learning increasingly rely on adjuncts for teaching, they really can't be writtn off for much longer.  I absolutely understand it was probably just about the need to analyze data in a simple and clean way, but it speaks to the fact that we actually have a complex situation on our hands.  There are adjuncts who are teaching at our intitutions who have incredible training, and are positioned to teach bioinformatics - and an array of other content areas - more expertly than many full-time faculty.

The emphasis is on the design of efficient algorithms and data structures, proofs of their correctness, and analysis of their complexity. Anumber of algorithmic concepts and techniques are covered, including recursion, incremental design, divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, and dynamic programming. The algorithms studied include sorting, searching, breadth-first search depth-first search, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, network flow, and string matching. Data structures studied include hash tables, heaps, binary search trees, and red-black trees. This course is meant as a follow-up to a course in data structure. Knowledge of elementary data structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists are assumed. In addition, a module will be given on algorithms relevant to bioinformatics, which studies molecular sequence data (DNA, RNA, and protein).

Despite repeated refernce to current students being ""digital natives"", most students have no functional knowledge of computers or programs beyond their handful of favorite apps on their phone.  It's a constant source of surprise given how ubiquitous computers are in their live.  For example, many students have no idea what the difference is between ""the internet"", ""an internet browser"", ""a server"", and other commonly used terms.  When the one thing they know how to do fails, many students have no idea how to work around it (e.., trying a different browser if an assigned activity doesn't work in their usual one).  I know that the students are capable of a lot, but the lack of experience and interest in anything computational is a large hurdle.  Many bioinformatics procedure are very button-click activities that allow students to follow directions without deeply thinking about material.

Students perform hands-on analyses using publicly available data and toolsBioinformatics in Medicine and Biology - In this course students learn about R and statistics and for their final project they analyze a publicly available datafrom start to end. They start with downloading and normalizing data, identifying differentially expressed genes, clustering and then finally Gene Ontology over-representation analysisProgramming for Biologists - Students learn how to write software prgrams in Python in order to analyze Next-generation sequencing dataBiological Databases and Datamining - Students learn about different types of Biological data and how to store and query them in relational databases such as MySQL and SQLite. They als learn how to use data-mining methods such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Clustering to analyze publicly available dataApplied Genomics - Analysis of Next-generation sequencing data using High Performance Computing (HPC) systems and R. Soe topics include RNA-seq, CHIP-seq, and SNP analysis",Students need a fundamental understanding of Statistics and also have to be comfortable writing some basic code in programming languages such as R and Python.

A major theme in bioinformatics is to integrate and understand biologica data generated by genome sequencing projects and other high-throughput molecular biology efforts. Bioinformatics tools are developed to reveal fundamental mechanisms underlying the structure and function of macromolecules, biochemical pathways, disease pocesses, and genome evolution  Although many bioinformatics problems are solved by computation and programming, this course itself does not require (practical) computer programming. However, it is expected that all of the students learn how to use the avalable bioinformatics software to solve biological problems. The aim is to emphasize critical thinking: understanding how these tools work in principle and developing a computational mind for biological problems. Major topics to be discussed in the course nclude: sequence analysis & algorithms, gene annotation, protein sequence analysis, proteomics, gene expression analysis, comparative genomics, genetic networks and pathways analysis, and systems biology.Biomedical BioinformaticsGenetics & Biochemisry Dept.Bioinformatics is a dynamic scientific discipline that utilizes computational and statistical methods for solving biological problems.  _Translational bioinformatics_ is an emerging discipline that bridges the gap between information stored n databases and application of this information to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease.

Because of its reliance on precision instrumentation and scale, and the unprecedented volume of dat produced, genomics is unusual among biological disciplines in its integration of engineering, statistics, and information science.  Genomics also requires the biologist to engage in systems thinking by taking a wide view of the dynamic physical and inforational network that comprises a single genome.  One must further consider the human genome as itself a component of an even larger network of genomes that make up the holobiont_that_s us plus our always-changing resident community of microbial pals.

Students will learn about vast resources that are available, how to access them, and retrieve only the desired iformation. Sequence comparison and alignment methods will be presented. Practical aspects of programming such as BLAST and FASTA will be discussed with class activities pertinent to these search engines as well as different strategies of multiplealignmens will be investigated. They will learn how to analyze protein sequences including secondary structure prediction, protein function prediction (based on motifs and functional domains), and structural modeling. The entire course will be well balanced betwen a theoretical description of computational biology methods and practical aspects of bioinformatics. Upon completion of this course, students will have sufficient knowledge to retrieve desired information from biological databases based on both text and equence data. They will learn what public resources are available in terms of databases and software. They will know how to interpret results in biological context and how to adjust different parameters in the software to obtain exact desired results.",The students already have many requirements to earn a degree so they may not choose to take a bioinformatics course when another course could fulfill the requirements of their degree.

Life scientists are generating huge amounts of data on many different scales, from DNA and protein sequence, to information on biological systems such as protein interaction netorks, brain circuitry, and ecosystems.  Analyzing these kinds of data requires quantitative knowledge and approaches using computer science and mathematics.  In this project-based course, students will use case studies to learn about both important biologcal problems and the computational tools and algorithms used to study them.  Students will study a sampling of topics in the field, including such areas as complex disease genetics, analysis of a flu epidemic, investigating antibiotic resistance, and undestanding the behavior of swarms, such as schooling fish.  Computational tools explored will include both freely-available web-based tools as well as guided programming using Python.Recommended background: High school biology. Programming experience is nt required.BCB 3010 / BB 3010 SIMULATION IN BIOLOGYCat II. Computer simulations are becoming increasingly important in understanding and predicting the behavior of a wide variety of biological systems, ranging from metastasis of cancer cells, to sprad of disease in an epidemic, to management of natural resources such as fisheries and forests.  In this course, students will learn to use a graphical programming language to simulate biological systems.  Most of the classroom time will be spent working ndividually or in groups, first learning the language, and then programming simulation projects.  We will also discuss several papers on biological simulations from the primary scientific literature.  In cons","What to teach, and how to teach it.  I think many faculty don't have the bioinformatics skills themselves, so it is really difficult to figure out what to teach.  Even if they do have some skills, they may not feel comfortable teaching them, particularly f they are trying to teach the underlying algorithms or statistics inherent in various methods.  And the tools seem to change so quickly, and there are so many available, that is difficult to choose what is most important for students to learn.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Now that I think about it, I can't give you URLs, because our course content is all on Blackboard, which is only accessible to students registered for the course.
