# n = the completed sample size

#2 Proportion Testing  #######################################################################################################

#a contigency table is the number of respondants who we scored as reporting a particular barrier (positive_cored_response) and those who provided
# no response, or did not answer the question (null_scored_response)

#Create contigency table and save in a temporary variable
subset.proportion.test <- df.summary %>%
  select(nice_names, responses, positive_scored_response, null_scored_response)%>%
  head(4)

View(subset.proportion.test)

#b Proportion test is calculated as:
proportion.test.results.wrong <- prop.test(subset.proportion.test$positive_scored_response, subset.proportion.test$null_scored_response)

# view p values
proportion.test.results$p.value

#This test has already been done and is represented in the data frame as
df.summary$err.prop_test_chi_pvalue


#Corrrect

#3 Power testing #######################################################################################################
# Certiantly need help here!
# Stepping back here to state my context and assumptions
# 966 people (n.sample) told us their carnegie classification
# At least 160 people answered a free text question on what their 'barrier' was, education, class size, etc. 
# Some people decided not to answer the question because they experienced no barrier, or they quit the survey (Rather hard to tell this)
# df.summary$summed_score shows the total number of individuals* who responded and were catagroized into a particular barrier
# * An individual may have been coded in more than one barrier, but no individual was counted twice in the same barrier
# The numbers in df.summary$summed_score are a lower-bound of my completed sample size
# The upper-bound of my completed sample size is 966, which assumes that everyone answered this question (where null is a valid answer)
# The upper-bound is not conservative, so I propose the following, that we assume the higest-number is the conservative-upper-bound, in this case 160 individuals
# Using the conservative-upper-bound, reject barrier codings which have insufficent power to detect a medium effect (0.5) at power p = 0.95

#sample power calculations


n.power.sample <- 41
pwr.2p.test(power = 0.95,
            n = n.power.sample, 
            sig.level = 0.05)

# Assuming my understanding is correct, we need at least 40 individuals in our sample before we report that we had power to detect at least a large (0.8) effect. So, 

#run power analysis

n.completed.barriers <- max(df.summary$summed_score)

df.summary.power <- df.summary%>%
  group_by(Var2)%>%
  do(power = pwr.2p.test(power =.95, n = .$summed_score[[1]])$h)%>%
  mutate(power = round(power, 2))

# sufficently powered categories (.8 or less)
df.summary.power <- df.summary.power%>%
  filter(power <= .8)

# Therefore, I should keep proportion tests where I had sufficent power to detect at least large effects, and chi-squared p values of 0.05 or less
results <- df.summary%>%
  filter (Var2 %in% df.summary.power$Var2)%>%
  filter (prop_test_chi_pvalue <= 0.05)
