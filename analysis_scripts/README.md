## Additional notes

### Script details

These analyses involve 7 scripts:

*Special analyses* 

- `mca-plot.R`: Multiple correspondence analysis of several survey responses
- `Top5_barriers.plots.R`: Side-by-side plotting of several question responses
- `summarize_and_plot_demographic_information/response_summary_plots.R`: Plots and tables summarizing the number of respondents in several demographic categories

*Analysis templates (templates/)*

Analyses are conducted on the following question, numbered as named

|Survey Question #|Question Text |Notes/Question aims|Template Script|
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
|Q06|“Optional: Please describe briefly; include any barriers to development and/or implementation.”|Barriers to implementation|`templates/question_06_template_barriers_to_implementation.R`|
|Q29-30|29: "At your current institution, do you face any technical barriers in teaching bioinformatics, e.g., availability of a computer lab, different operating systems, access to high performance computing for teaching, IT support?"<br> <br>30:"Optional: Please describe."|Technical barriers to implementation|`templates/question_29-30_template_technical_challenges.R`|
|Q33|"In your opinion, what do you think are the most important challenges currently facing those educating undergraduate life scientists in bioinformatics?"|Educator challenges|`templates/question_33_template_educator_challenges.R`|
|Q38|"What is preventing you from including bioinformatics content in these courses?"|Barriers to inclusion|`templates/question_38_template_barriers_to_inclusion.R`|

*Running analysis template scripts*

Each of the template scripts have sections that are custom for that question (i.e. which variables/columns from the survey data). In addition to run the script from a template the following items are customized:

1. The variable for the demographic to be analyzed needs to be selected long with custom names for outputs:
    
     ```
    # set the variable (Question) that will be analyzed:"COLUMN_NAME"
category.column.name <- ""

    # set a 'nice' (e.g. human readable) name to describe this category: "Category (Q#)"
category.column.name.nice <- ""

    # set a 'safe name' for naming variables: "Q#_category_category"
category.column.name.safe <- ""

    # set a 'short' for naming filename variables: "Q#_category_category"
category.column.name.short <- ""

    #set a nice name in upper and lower case that describes the category kinds 
#(e.g. gender, institution type): ""

    category.nice.name.caps <- ""
category.nice.name.lower <- ""
```
2. A `category.levels` variable is set to indicate which of the responses to a demographic will be analyzed. For example, if there are 3 levels (e.g '1_Female', '2_Male', '3_NA') selecting the range category.levels[1:2] will eliminate NA values from the analysis:
    ```
    #Set levels to retain ( excluding for example responses such as 'Don't Know     or 'NA')
# select the range of values within category.levels to use (e.g. category.levels[1:4])
category.levels <- category.levels[1:4]
```
3. Create a data frame that will contain nicely formatted names:
```
#Nice names data frame - create a datframe of nice names for your categories, you must
#complete the df for all of the categories
#example:
#category.df <- data.frame ("Associates"= category.levels[1], 
#                           "Baccalaureate" = category.levels[2] , 
#                           "Masters" = category.levels[3] , 
#                           "Doctoral" = category.levels[4], 
#                           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

    
    category.df <- data.frame ("Associates"= category.levels[1], 
                           "Baccalaureate" = category.levels[2] , 
                           "Masters" = category.levels[3] , 
                           "Doctoral" = category.levels[4], 
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Naming - Output names start with an identification of the survey question the template is derived from (%%%) and the demographic question (~~~) survey respondents are drawn from.
