#### Additional notes

##### Script details

These analyses involve 7 scripts:

Special analyses 

- `mca-plot.R`: Multiple correspondence analysis of several survey responses
- `Top5_barriers.plots.R`: Side-by-side plotting of several question responses
- `summarize_and_plot_demographic_information/response_summary_plots.R`: Plots and tables summarizing the number of respondents in several demographic categories

Analysis templates (templates/)

Analyses are conducted on the following question, numbered as named

|Survey Question #|Question Text |Notes/Question aims|Template Script|
