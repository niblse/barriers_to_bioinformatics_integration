## Additional notes

The data analyzed focused on primarily on keyword analysis of free-response questions in the survey. 

|Manuscript Question No.|Qualtrics CSV Question No.|Question|
|-----------------------|----------------------|--------|
|1|33|“In your opinion, what do you think are the most important challenges currently facing those educating undergraduate life scientists in bioinformatics?”|
|2|6 (2b)|<ul><li>Question 2a (multiple choice; not keyword coded): “What is the level of the courses you teach in which you would like to include bioinformatics content?”<li>Question 2b: “Please describe briefly; include any barriers to development and/or implementation.”|
|3*|38|“What is preventing you from including bioinformatics content in these courses?” |
|4|29|“At your current institution, do you face any technical barriers in teaching bioinformatics, e.g., availability of a computer lab, different operating systems, access to high performance computing for teaching, IT support -  Please describe.”|


*Question 3 was only asked to respondents who indicated they were not currently implementing bioinformatics.
