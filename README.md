|summed_reduced_factors.R|This script takes binary_scores.csv and creates two new column types: A **sum** column takes similar groupings of barriers and sums all responses - the sum **does not** include  barrier columns labeled "general" as the general columns are which are binary indications of any score in a category (e.g. faculty issues). A **reduced** column transforms the value of a **sum** column into a binary; 0 for any sum == 0, 1 for any sum != 0 | NA|data_cleaning_scripts/03_sum_and_reduce_barrier_coding/

|decoded_responses.R|Takes the summed_reduced_factors.csv file and replaces all survey responses (not scored barriers) and transforms values from drop-down selections (e.g. 1,2,3) into their human-readable responses (e.g. male, female, other). The decoded response retains the value as recorded in the survey output for (e.g. Q14_Sex the decoded values "1_Female" indicates that the survey score was originally "1" was interpreted here as Female). The survey output was kept in place to avoid possible manual error in the decoding script.|NA|data_cleaning_scripts/04_decode_survey_responses|
